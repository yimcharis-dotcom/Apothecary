#### Step-by-Step Implementation of a PARA-Based Vault

1. **Create Your Vault**: Open Obsidian, create a new vault in a synced folder (e.g., Dropbox for cross-device access). Name it "Personal Knowledge Base" or similar.
2. **Set Up Core Folders**:
    - Prefix with numbers for forced sidebar order (e.g., 01-, 02-) to override alphabetical sorting.
        
    - Create these top-level folders:
        
        |Folder (Prefixed)|Purpose|Example Contents|
        |---|---|---|
        |00-Inbox|Temporary landing for unprocessed captures|Quick ideas, clippings, daily dumps|
        |01-Daily Notes|Periodic journaling and entry point|Auto-generated daily/weekly notes|
        |02-Projects|Active, goal-oriented work|System Spec Generator, Grammar Checker Project, Current Audit Client|
        |03-Areas|Ongoing responsibilities and interests|Audit & Accounting, AI Learning, Health & Fitness, Hobbies|
        |04-Resources|Reference materials and tools|Prompt Library, Standards (IFRS/GAAS), Articles & Books|
        |05-Archives|Inactive/completed items|Old projects, superseded notes|
        |06-Utilities|System files|Templates, Attachments, Scripts|
