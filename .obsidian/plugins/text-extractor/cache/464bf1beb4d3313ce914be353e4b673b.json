{"path":"40_Experiments/Grammer checkor/Raw/Think step by step _Act as an __English grammar ch.docx","text":"Think step by step Act as an **English grammar checker designer\"Now the target users are C1-lev ESL L1 Cantonese speakers, causal and professional contexts.You need a full, exhaustive list of errors + minimal pairs, A checker must identify A checker must flag and explain, A checker must only flag A C1-focused checker for Cantonese L1 users should prioritize fossilized, high-impact grammar and usage issues (especially articles, countability, tense/aspect, and prepositions), then offer graded warnings for subtler or stylistic points.[1][2][3][4][5][6]Below is a design spec with three strictness levels and minimal pairs for each error type. Design overview Research on Hong Kong Cantonese ESL users shows persistent problems with countable vs uncountable nouns, article choice, tense marking, prepositions, and non-finite verb patterns, even at higher proficiency levels. These are often driven by L1 transfer from Cantonese, which lacks articles and has different ways of expressing tense and prepositional relations.[2][7][3][4][5][6][1] The checker should therefore: Treat “must identify” errors as virtually always wrong in any context, suitable for confident auto-suggestions. Treat “must flag and explain” errors as systematic but context-sensitive, needing user education and a clear explanation. Treat “only flag” items as low-confidence or stylistic, where the tool offers a soft suggestion without asserting it is wrong. Errors to identify These are clear grammatical violations or globally non-standard forms where an automatic suggestion is safe. 1. Subject–verb agreement (core patterns) Present simple third-person mismatch: INCORRECT: She go to the office every day. CORRECT: She goes to the office every day. “There is/are” with clear plural: INCORRECT: There is many issues in this report. CORRECT: There are many issues in this report. 2. Countable/uncountable nouns and impossible plurals Cantonese L1 learners often overpluralize uncountable nouns or treat them as countable because Cantonese does not mark this distinction morphologically.[5][6][1][2] Uncountable noun with plural -s: INCORRECT: We need more informations for the proposal. CORRECT: We need more information for the proposal. Uncountable with “many” instead of “much”: INCORRECT: There are many research on this topic. CORRECT: There is much research on this topic. 3. Plural marking after numerals and quantifiers Missing plural after numeral: INCORRECT: We hired three new staff member this month. CORRECT: We hired three new staff members this month. Wrong number after “a lot of / few / several”: INCORRECT: We received several feedback from clients. CORRECT: We received several pieces of feedback from clients. 4. Core tense morphology (past and third-person -s) Cantonese marks aspect differently and often allows bare verbs for past reference, which leads to omission of English tense morphology.[4] Missing past tense with explicit past time: INCORRECT: Yesterday we discuss the budget. CORRECT: Yesterday we discussed the budget. Missing third-person singular -s in habitual actions: INCORRECT: My manager often check the numbers carefully. CORRECT: My manager often checks the numbers carefully. 5. Modal and auxiliary verb patterns Modal + bare infinitive (no “to”): INCORRECT: She can to join the meeting later. CORRECT: She can join the meeting later. “Do/does/did” + bare infinitive: INCORRECT: He didn’t went to the training yesterday. CORRECT: He didn’t go to the training yesterday. 6. Obligatory prepositions with specific verbs Studies of Hong Kong English show frequent omission of prepositions like “to” and “for” in fixed verb-preposition combinations (e.g. apply ___ a job).[8][4] Omitted “to” with “apply”: INCORRECT: I applied the position last week. CORRECT: I applied for the position last week. Omitted “to” with “listen”: INCORRECT: Please listen me carefully. CORRECT: Please listen to me carefully. 7. Non-finite verb after prepositions and certain verbs Gerund after preposition: INCORRECT: She is responsible for check the invoices. CORRECT: She is responsible for checking the invoices. Bare infinitive after “to” in purpose clauses: INCORRECT: We arranged a call to clarifying the details. CORRECT: We arranged a call to clarify the details. 8. Core question formation and inversion Cantonese often forms questions by adding a particle or relying on intonation, which leads to missing subject–auxiliary inversion in English questions.[1] Wh-question without inversion: INCORRECT: Why you are late to the meeting? CORRECT: Why are you late to the meeting? Yes/no question without inversion: INCORRECT: You finished the report? (in formal email) CORRECT: Have you finished the report? 9. Basic run-ons and comma splices Comma splice: INCORRECT: The figures look good, we can relax now. CORRECT: The figures look good, so we can relax now. Fused sentence: INCORRECT: I read your email I will reply tomorrow. CORRECT: I read your email, and I will reply tomorrow. 10. Pronoun case in standard patterns Object pronoun after preposition: INCORRECT: The manager spoke to John and I. CORRECT: The manager spoke to John and me. Subject pronoun in coordinated subject: INCORRECT: Me and my team will handle it. CORRECT: My team and I will handle it. Errors to flag and explain These are common, often L1-driven, but context-dependent; the checker should highlight them and provide short explanations, not just corrections. 1. Article choice (a/an, the, zero) Hong Kong Cantonese learners struggle with mapping articles to definiteness and countability, often overusing or omitting them.[3][1] Overuse of “the” with general reference: LIKELY ISSUE: The teamwork is important in the workplace. MORE NATURAL: Teamwork is important in the workplace. Missing article with first mention of a singular count noun: LIKELY ISSUE: We hired new designer last week. MORE NATURAL: We hired a new designer last week. 2. Count vs mass when both are possible Learners often confuse pairs like paper/a paper, chicken/a chicken, experience/experiences.[6][1] Using mass where count is intended: LIKELY ISSUE: I had many experience with client complaints. MORE NATURAL: I had a lot of experience with client complaints. Using count where mass is intended: LIKELY ISSUE: We ordered three chickens for lunch (meaning three portions, not three whole animals). MORE NATURAL: We ordered some chicken for lunch. 3. Aspect: “already”, perfect vs past Because Cantonese expresses completion via particles rather than tense morphology, learners may overuse simple past or combine “already” with non-target-like forms.[4] Simple present with “already”: LIKELY ISSUE: I already submit the form. MORE NATURAL: I have already submitted the form. Overuse of simple past where experience is meant: LIKELY ISSUE: I went to France three times. MORE NATURAL: I have been to France three times. 4. Gerunds vs infinitives beyond core patterns Cantonese speakers are documented to overuse or misplace -ing forms.[9] Gerund vs infinitive with subject function: LIKELY ISSUE: To play tennis is fun. (formal but marked) MORE NATURAL: Playing tennis is fun. Gerund after “can”: LIKELY ISSUE: Can you cooking tonight? MORE NATURAL: Can you cook tonight? 5. Verb–preposition and verb–object collocations Many advanced learners fossilize semi-fixed but non-standard collocations like “discuss about” or “emphasize on”.[8][4] Overused preposition after “discuss”: LIKELY ISSUE: We will discuss about the budget tomorrow. MORE NATURAL: We will discuss the budget tomorrow. Wrong preposition with “provide”: LIKELY ISSUE: They provided to us all the data. MORE NATURAL: They provided us with all the data. 6. Relative clauses and “which/that/who/where” Cantonese relative clause structure is very different, which encourages dropping relative pronouns or misusing “where/which”.[4] Dropped relative pronoun: LIKELY ISSUE: The report I sent yesterday is updated. MORE STANDARD: The report that I sent yesterday is updated. Misuse of “where” for “which”: LIKELY ISSUE: We had a meeting where we discussed the budget. (OK in many contexts, but ambiguous in writing) MORE PRECISE: We had a meeting in which we discussed the budget. 7. Word order influenced by Cantonese topic/time patterns Cantonese often places time and topic elements early, which can lead to unusual but understandable English word order.[7] Over-fronted time phrase: LIKELY ISSUE: This morning in the office we all discussed the problem. MORE NEUTRAL: We all discussed the problem in the office this morning. Topic-fronting: LIKELY ISSUE: This proposal, I think we need to revise. MORE NEUTRAL: I think we need to revise this proposal. 8. Formal vs casual register and direct translations Cantonese tends to be more direct; literal translations may sound blunt or overly casual in professional English.[1] Over-direct request in email: LIKELY ISSUE: Send me the file now. MORE POLITE: Could you send me the file now? Literal encouragement: LIKELY ISSUE: Add oil in your exam! MORE NATURAL: Good luck with your exam! 9. Overuse of “very”, “so”, “too” “Too” used as a simple intensifier without negative implication: LIKELY ISSUE: The meeting was too long (but speaker means “very long”, not “excessively long”). MORE PRECISE: The meeting was very long. “So” in formal writing: LIKELY ISSUE: The results are so good. MORE FORMAL: The results are extremely good. Errors to only flag These issues are often stylistic, dialectal (e.g. Hong Kong English features), or context-sensitive. The checker should highlight them gently (e.g. “Consider revising…”) without declaring them wrong. 1. Long, dense sentences in professional writing Possible overlong sentence: ORIGINAL: Although the client approved the concept last week and we have already briefed the design team, we still need to confirm the final budget before proceeding to the production phase, which might delay the launch. POSSIBLE REVISION: Split into two or three shorter sentences. 2. Passive vs active voice Heavy passive structure: ORIGINAL: The proposal was reviewed and was approved by management yesterday. POSSIBLE REVISION: Management reviewed and approved the proposal yesterday. 3. Choice between near-synonyms and collocational strength Slightly odd but understandable collocation: ORIGINAL: We will do a meeting next Monday. PREFERRED: We will have a meeting next Monday. Slightly off register: ORIGINAL: The issue is quite serious, we must fix it ASAP. PREFERRED (formal): The issue is serious; we must fix it as soon as possible. 4. Local Hong Kong English items Some expressions are widely used locally but may not be understood internationally; the checker should flag them only if the target audience is “global”.[4] Local expression: ORIGINAL: Let’s chop the contract this afternoon. GLOBAL ENGLISH: Let’s stamp/sign the contract this afternoon. Local nouning/verbing: ORIGINAL: I will help you to follow this case. GLOBAL ENGLISH: I will help you follow up on this case. 5. Generic “they”, gender-neutral forms, and style Gender-neutral singular “they”: ORIGINAL: If a manager disagrees, they should explain their reasons. ALTERNATIVE (more formal/legalistic if required): If a manager disagrees, he or she should explain the reasons. 6. Contractions in professional vs casual contexts Casual in formal email: ORIGINAL: We’ll get back to you soon. MORE FORMAL: We will get back to you soon. Overly formal in chat: ORIGINAL: I do not think that is possible. MORE NATURAL (casual): I don’t think that’s possible. Using minimal pairs in the checker For each rule above, the checker should: Store at least one minimal pair (incorrect/correct or less natural/more natural) to display when the user hovers or clicks for help, with labels like “Non-standard” vs “More natural in professional emails”. Differentiate severity in the UI: red underline + correction button for “must identify”, amber underline + explanation for “flag and explain”, and grey dotted underline + “style suggestion” label for “only flag”. This design aligns with documented Cantonese–English interference patterns while respecting advanced users’ need for nuance, choice of register, and local Hong Kong English norms.[2][3][5][6][1][4] ⁂ https://hongkongtesol.com/blog/top-10-grammar-mistakes-hong-kong-part-1 https://simplyenglish.com.hk/common-errors-hk-students/ https://caes.hku.hk/ajal/index.php/ajal/article/download/432/467/1649 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/syntactic-variation-in-hong-kong-english/9E527EA694A33CFE6D3A16CCE9FCDC43 https://www.lc.cityu.edu.hk/ELSS/Resource/cce1/index.htm https://elc.polyu.edu.hk/cill/eap/2004/u1/nouncorrection.aspx https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_grammar https://wacclearinghouse.org/docs/jbw/v1n1/lay.pdf https://hongkongtesol.com/blog/top-10-grammar-mistakes-hong-kong-part-2 https://www.cantoneseclass101.com/blog/2020/12/11/common-cantonese-mistakes/ https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/the-acquisition-of-english-grammar-and-phonology-by-cantonese-esl https://eccantonese123.rako.co/en/blog/Common_Mistakes_English_Speakers_Make_When_Learning_Cantonese https://mirror1.dsedj.gov.mo/tplan/2020/plan/C102.pdf https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/the-acquisition-of-english-grammar-and-phonology-by-cantonese-esl/ https://kctang.com.hk/web/common-errors-use-english https://www.britishaccentacademy.com/most-common-english-pronunciation-errors-made-by-cantonese-speakers/ https://iccomipe.org/9-common-grammar-mistakes-in-english-and-how-to-avoid-them/ https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003252498/acquisition-english-grammar-phonology-cantonese-esl-learners-alice-yin-wa-chan https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096524000237 https://www.studocu.com/hk/document/the-university-of-hong-kong/business-communication/session-5-handout-common-grammar-errors-in-business-communication/85118656","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
