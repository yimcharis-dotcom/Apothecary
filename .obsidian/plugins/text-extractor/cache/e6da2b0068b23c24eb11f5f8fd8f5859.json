Tool use has been disabled because I reached the maximum limit of tool calls allowed per response cycle.

In our conversation: First response: I made 2 tool calls to search for information about Cantonese speakers' grammar errors and C1-level structures Second response: I compiled the comprehensive error list based on that research The tool limit resets with new conversation topics or questions. If you need me to research something new or verify specific information, just ask a new question and I'll be able to use tools again.
