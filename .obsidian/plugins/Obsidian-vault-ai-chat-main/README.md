## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating Files

```
/create quick-note              → Creates quick-note.md in vault root
/create Projects/meeting-notes  → Creates Projects/meeting-notes.md
/create Archive/2024/January    → Creates file with nested folders
```

### AI-Generated Content

```

### Natural Language

You can also just ask naturally:

- "Write a note about productivity tips" → AI generates content with a save button
- "Create a meal plan for next week" → AI writes it, you click save

### File Management

```
/mkdir Projects/2024/Q1         → Creates nested folder structure
/list Projects                  → Shows files in Projects folder
/read README                    → Displays README.md contents
/append Daily Log.md Had lunch  → Adds text to Daily Log.md
/delete old-draft               → Deletes old-draft.md (with confirmation)
/rmdir Archive/Old              → Deletes folder and everything inside
```

## 🛠️ Building from Source

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version 16 or newer) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic familiarity with the command line/terminal

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Get the source code**

```bash
# If you have the source zip, extract it to a folder
# Or clone from git if available
```

**Step 2: Open a terminal/command prompt**

- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, press Enter
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

**Step 3: Navigate to the plugin folder**

```bash
cd path/to/vault-ai-chat
```

(Replace `path/to/vault-ai-chat` with the actual folder location)

**Step 4: Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all the required code libraries. It may take a minute.

**Step 5: Build the plugin**

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript that Obsidian can run.

**Step 6: Copy to Obsidian**
After building, you'll have these files:

- `main.js`
- `manifest.json`
- `styles.css`

Copy all three to your Obsidian vault:

```
YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/vault-ai-chat/
```

**Step 7: Enable the plugin**

1. Restart Obsidian
2. Go to Settings → Community Plugins
3. Find "Vault AI Chat" and enable it

### Development Mode (for making changes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This watches for changes and Apothecarys automatically.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "No AI provider configured"

→ Go to Settings → Vault AI Chat and enter your API key

### "Authentication Error"

→ Check that your API key is correct and has credit/quota

### "Model Not Found"

→ The model name may be wrong. Check the provider's documentation.

### Chat is slow

→ Try a faster model (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`)

### Responses are cut off

→ Increase "Max tokens" in settings

### Plugin doesn't appear

→ Make sure all 3 files are in the plugin folder and restart Obsidian
