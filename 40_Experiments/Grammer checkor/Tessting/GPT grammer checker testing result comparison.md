## 1\. Annotated Text

Hey Dr. Martinez, I wanted to reach out regarding the quarterly financial statements.
The data shows significant revenue growth, *however the board feel the projections is overly optimistic*\[1.].
*We're doing researches*\[2.] on market trends, and based on this analysis, *I suggest you reconsider your assumptions since your relatively new to this sector*\[3.].
*The equipments purchased last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, and making amendments to the balance sheet are critical*\[4.].
Internet connectivity issues *has prevented*\[5.] timely reporting.
Please *advice*\[6.] on how to proceed, as we *need respond*\[7.] by *end of week*\[8.].

Tier 2 items (need explanations) are in bold italics below:

* ***however the board feel the projections is overly optimistic***\[1.]
* ***We're doing researches***\[2.]
* ***I suggest you reconsider your assumptions since your relatively new to this sector***\[3.]
* ***The equipments purchased last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, and making amendments to the balance sheet are critical***\[4.]
* ***Please advice on how to proceed***\[6.]

## 2\. Explanations (Tier 2 only)

\[1.] \[Prescriptive] “however the board feel the projections is overly optimistic” – Coordination and agreement
Rule: “However” starting a new clause after a full stop or semicolon is more standard in formal writing, and “board” takes a singular verb in this context. “Projections” is plural, so the verb must match.
Impact: The current structure sounds informal and has subject–verb disagreement, which weakens professionalism.
Alternatives:

* “However, the board feels the projections are overly optimistic.”
* “However, the board believes the projections are overly optimistic.”

\[2.] \[Prescriptive] “We’re doing researches” – Countability error
Rule: “Research” is an uncountable noun in standard English and does not normally take a plural form.
Impact: Using “researches” in this sense signals non-native usage in a professional context.
Alternatives:

* “We’re doing research on market trends.”
* “We’re conducting research on market trends.”

\[3.] \[Naturalness] “I suggest you reconsider your assumptions since your relatively new to this sector” – Naturalness and pronoun error
Rule: “Since you’re relatively new to this sector” needs the contraction “you’re” (you are), and in formal emails, it is more natural to soften the phrasing slightly.
Impact: The directness plus the pronoun error can sound careless or overly blunt in a professional email.
Alternatives:

* “I suggest you reconsider your assumptions, as you’re relatively new to this sector.”
* “I would suggest revisiting your assumptions, given that you’re relatively new to this sector.”

\[4.] \[Prescriptive] “The equipments purchased last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, and making amendments to the balance sheet are critical” – Mass noun, agreement, and parallelism
Rule: “Equipment” is an uncountable noun; the verb should agree with the (implied) plural items, and the second clause needs singular agreement with “making.”
Impact: Multiple agreement and countability issues make the sentence hard to parse and less professional.
Alternatives:

* “The equipment purchased last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, and making amendments to the balance sheet is critical.”
* “The equipment purchased last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, so it is critical to amend the balance sheet.”

\[6.] \[Prescriptive] “Please advice on how to proceed” – Word form
Rule: “Advice” is the noun; “advise” is the verb. Here a verb is required.
Impact: Using the wrong form is a common learner error and noticeable in written business communication.
Alternatives:

* “Please advise on how to proceed.”
* “Could you please advise on how we should proceed?”

## 3\. Native Speaker Alternatives

* Neutral/formal:
  “Dear Dr. Martinez, the data shows significant revenue growth; however, the board feels the projections are overly optimistic. We are conducting research on market trends, and based on this analysis, I suggest you reconsider your assumptions, as you’re relatively new to this sector. The equipment purchased last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, and it is critical to amend the balance sheet. Internet connectivity issues have prevented timely reporting. Please advise on how to proceed, as we need to respond by the end of the week.”
* More formal (financial):
  “Dear Dr. Martinez, the data indicates significant revenue growth; however, the board believes the projections may be overly optimistic. We are conducting research on market trends and, based on this analysis, recommend revisiting your assumptions, given that you are relatively new to this sector. The equipment acquired last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, and it is critical to adjust the balance sheet. Internet connectivity issues have delayed timely reporting. Please advise on how to proceed, as we need to provide a response by the end of the week.”
* Slightly more direct but still professional:
  “Dear Dr. Martinez, the data reflects strong revenue growth, but the board feels the projections are too optimistic. We are carrying out research on market trends and, in light of this, I suggest you reconsider your assumptions, as you’re relatively new to this sector. The equipment purchased last quarter was depreciated incorrectly, so updating the balance sheet is critical. Internet connectivity issues have prevented timely reporting. Please advise on how to proceed, as we need to respond by the end of the week.”

# So I've been trying to setup the new authentication system for our app, and honestly the documentation doesn't really help understanding the OAuth flow. Me and my team was debugging this issue for three days straight. The error messages keeps saying "invalid token" but we're doing everything correct according to the guides. I think the problem are in how the API handles refresh tokens, since it seem like tokens expires too quickly. We need figure out if this behavior is intentional or if there's configuration options we're missing. Has anyone dealt with similar problems? Would appreciate if someone could explain what's the proper way to implement this, because currently our users can't barely login without getting frustrated.

The text is clear but has several grammar and naturalness issues; below is a detailed annotation and correction.[^2\_1](Grammar-Checker-Tier-Classification-Edge-Cases.md)

## 2\. Explanations (Tier 2 only)

\[3.] \[Prescriptive] “Me and my team was debugging this issue” – Subject form and agreement
Rule: In compound subjects, “my team and I” is standard, and with a plural subject the verb should be plural (“were debugging”).[^2\_1](Grammar-Checker-Tier-Classification-Edge-Cases.md)
Impact: The current form sounds non-standard and informal in writing.
Alternatives:

* “My team and I were debugging this issue for three days straight.”
* “My team and I have been debugging this issue for three days.”

\[6.] \[Prescriptive] “I think the problem are in how the API handles refresh tokens, since it seem like tokens expires too quickly” – Agreement and verb forms
Rule: “Problem” is singular and takes “is”; “it seems” needs the third-person singular form, and “tokens expire” is plural.[^2\_1](Grammar-Checker-Tier-Classification-Edge-Cases.md)
Impact: Multiple agreement errors reduce clarity and professionalism.
Alternatives:

* “I think the problem is in how the API handles refresh tokens, since it seems like tokens expire too quickly.”
* “I think the issue lies in how the API handles refresh tokens, because the tokens seem to expire too quickly.”

\[7.] \[Prescriptive] “We need figure out” – Missing “to”
Rule: After “need” followed by a verb, use “to + verb” (“need to figure out”).[^2\_1](Grammar-Checker-Tier-Classification-Edge-Cases.md)
Impact: Omitting “to” is noticeable and informal in written English.
Alternatives:

* “We need to figure out if this behavior is intentional…”
* “We need to determine whether this behavior is intentional…”

\[8.] \[Naturalness] “Would appreciate if someone could explain what's the proper way to implement this” – Missing subject and phrasing
Rule: In writing, especially semi-formal, “I/we would appreciate it if…” is more natural; “what the proper way is” is also more standard word order.[^2\_1](Grammar-Checker-Tier-Classification-Edge-Cases.md)
Impact: The truncated form is common in speech but looks incomplete in writing.
Alternatives:

* “I would appreciate it if someone could explain what the proper way to implement this is.”
* “We would really appreciate it if someone could explain the proper way to implement this.”

## 3\. Native Speaker Alternatives

* Neutral (developer forum / internal chat):
  “I’ve been trying to set up the new authentication system for our app, but the documentation doesn’t really help with understanding the OAuth flow. My team and I have been debugging this issue for three days straight. The error messages keep saying ‘invalid token’, but we’re doing everything correctly according to the guides.

We need to figure out whether this behavior is intentional or if there are configuration options we’re missing. Has anyone dealt with similar problems? We would really appreciate it if someone could explain the proper way to implement this, because right now our users can barely log in without getting frustrated.”
* Slightly more formal (email to vendor/support):
  “I’ve been trying to set up the new authentication system for our application, but the documentation doesn’t clearly explain the OAuth flow. My team and I have been debugging this issue for three days. The error messages repeatedly say ‘invalid token’, even though we are following the guides correctly. It appears that the API may not be handling refresh tokens as expected, since the tokens seem to expire very quickly. We need to determine whether this behavior is intentional or if there are configuration options we are missing. Has anyone encountered similar issues? I would appreciate it if someone could clarify the proper way to implement this, as our users can barely log in without becoming frustrated.”
* Casual but clean (Slack / Discord):
  “I’ve been trying to set up the new auth system for our app, but the docs don’t really help with understanding the OAuth flow. My team and I have been debugging this for three days straight. We keep getting ‘invalid token’ errors, even though we’re following the guides correctly. It looks like the API might not be handling refresh tokens properly, because the tokens seem to expire really fast. We need to figure out whether that’s intentional or if we’re missing some config options. Has anyone run into something similar? I’d really appreciate it if someone could explain the right way to implement this, because our users can barely log in without getting frustrated.”
