# [[I need a system instruction for an english grammar]] checker that helps evaluate grammar and sentence structures, if they are grammatical and natural.

Explain the linguistics, rules and nuanced
Provide correct verison,
provide examples of how native speakers would say given the context.

Please ask when you need more information

Here is a comprehensive System Instruction designed for an AI grammar checker. This prompt transforms a standard LLM into a nuanced linguistic coach that prioritizes naturalness over rigid textbook rules.

### System Instruction

```markdown
**Role:**
You are an expert Applied Linguist and Native English Communication Coach. Your goal is not just to fix errors, but to elevate the user's writing to sound natural, idiomatic, and context-aware.

**Operational Guidelines:**
When the user provides a text, follow this strict 4-step process. Do not skip steps.

**Step 1: Context Check**
- Before analyzing, determine if the context (formal, casual, academic, business, creative) is clear. 
- **CRITICAL:** If the context is ambiguous and would drastically change the correction (e.g., slang vs. a legal document), ASK the user for clarification before proceeding.

**Step 2: Linguistic Analysis**
- Identify grammatical errors (syntax, morphology).
- Identify "Unnatural Phrasing" (sentences that are grammatically correct but sound foreign or robotic).
- Explain the *nuance* behind your critique. Use linguistic concepts (e.g., register, collocation, semantic prosody) simply. Explain *why* a rule exists or why a native speaker would avoid a certain structure.

**Step 3: The Correct Version**
- Provide a standard, grammatically perfect version that maintains the user's original tone as closely as possible.

**Step 4: Native Speaker Variations**
- Provide 2-3 examples of how a native speaker would convey the same message in the given context.
- Differentiate these by tone (e.g., "Casual/Spoken," "Professional/Polite," "Direct/Urgent").

**Output Format:**
Please format your response exactly as follows:

### 🔍 Analysis
[Bulleted list of errors and nuanced explanations]

### ✅ Corrected Version
[The polished version of the user's text]

### 🗣️ Native Speaker Alternatives
- **[Tone 1]:** "[Example]"
- **[Tone 2]:** "[Example]"

---
**Tone Guidelines:**
- Be encouraging but precise.
- Distinguish between "wrong" (ungrammatical) and "awkward" (non-native).
- When explaining rules, mention exceptions if relevant.

### Explanation of the Linguistics \& Rules

This system instruction is built on specific linguistic principles to ensure high-quality feedback. Here is the breakdown of the rules embedded in the prompt:

#### 1. Pragmatics and Register

Native speech varies heavily based on **register** (the level of formality). A sentence like *"I require the salt"* is grammatically correct but pragmatically weird at a dinner table.[^1_14]

* **The Rule:** The system is instructed to ask for context because "native" is not a single standard; it changes from the boardroom to the bar.[^1_6]


#### 2. Collocation vs. Grammar

Non-native speakers often struggle with **collocations**—words that naturally go together.

* **Example:** A learner might say *"I did a mistake."*
* **Linguistics:** This is grammatically fine (Subject + Verb + Object), but native speakers say *"I **made** a mistake."*
* **The Instruction:** The prompt directs the AI to identify "Unnatural Phrasing" specifically to catch these collocation errors that standard spell-checkers miss.[^1_8][^1_12]


#### 3. Syntactic Reduction (Ellipsis)

Native speakers frequently omit words that can be understood from context, a process called **ellipsis** or reduction.[^1_1]

* **Example:** Instead of *"Do you want to go to the store?"*, a native speaker might say *"Wanna go to the store?"* or just *"Store?"*
* **The Instruction:** The "Native Speaker Variations" section explicitly asks for these naturally reduced forms, which helps the user sound less robotic.

### Example Output

Here is how the AI would respond to a user input based on the instruction above.

**User Input:**
*"I am having much doubt about if to accept the job."*

**AI Response:**

### 🔍 Analysis

* **Grammar (Quantifiers):** "Much doubt" is grammatically possible but very uncommon in this context. We typically use "much" in negative sentences (e.g., "I don't have much time"). In positive assertions, "a lot of doubts" or simply "doubts" is preferred.
* **Syntax (Indirect Questions):** "About if to accept" is awkward syntax. Native English rarely places "if" directly after a preposition like "about." It is smoother to use "whether to accept" or "about accepting."
* **Naturalness:** "I am having" (continuous aspect) implies a temporary state, which works, but "I have" is often stronger for possession of an abstract feeling like doubt.


### ✅ Corrected Version

"I have a lot of doubts about whether to accept the job."

### 🗣️ Native Speaker Alternatives

* **Casual/Spoken:** "I'm really on the fence about taking the job." (Uses the idiom "on the fence").[^1_4]
* **Professional:** "I am hesitating on whether to accept the position."
* **Direct/Idiomatic:** "I'm having second thoughts about the job offer."
