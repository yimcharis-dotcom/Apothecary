preserve the structure across sessions, Here’s your checkpoint summary: Progress Recap 1. Framework settled Two-tier system logic locked: Tier 1: universal, context-free mechanical rules (closed whitelist). Tier 2: interpretive and L1-transfer-related grammar + naturalness. Diagnostic principle clarified: instant agreement → Tier 1; requires intent/context → Tier 2. 2. Tier 1 Draft whitelist completed (subject–verb agreement, plural -s, apostrophes, capitalization, spacing, typos, fragments, etc.). Confirmed that Tier 1 is language-universal—Cantonese L1 not relevant here. 3. Tier 2 Skeleton created with two sub-tracks: Tier 2-G: grammar/structure (articles, prepositions, tense/aspect, countability, irregular plurals, transitivity, dummy subjects, word-form, comparatives). Tier 2-N: naturalness/collocation/discourse (word order, collocation, register, cohesion). Next task: finalize these categories and attach minimal pairs; decide which ones you personally never need flagged. Next Session Start Point → Begin from: “Step 1 – tighten and finalize Tier 2 category skeleton.” Optional follow-ups: build minimal pairs, formalize Tier 1 diagnostic test, CSV validation plan.

Bookmark Format Just copy and keep this note somewhere (in a doc, Notion, or wherever you track projects). When you return, paste it as your first message, and I’ll be able to re-establish the full context. PROJECT BOOKMARK — CHARIS TIER SYSTEM Context: Grammar checker design for C1 Cantonese L1 users. Tier 1: Closed whitelist of mechanical, context-free errors (SVA, plural -s, apostrophes, capitalization, typos, fragments, run-ons, punctuation spacing). Tier 2: Context-dependent and transfer-related errors. T2-G: articles, prepositions, tense/aspect, countability, irregular plurals, transitivity, dummy subjects, word-form, comparatives. T2-N: word order, collocation, register, cohesion. Next step: tighten and finalize Tier 2 skeleton; then add minimal pairs and mark which error types need flagging. How to use it Next time, start the chat with: “Load this bookmark and resume from the next step.” I’ll instantly Apothecary the reasoning structure from it and pick up at the right level of detail. Would you like me to make a compact “reload prompt” version (just one line to paste next time)
